                            <p>An innovative technology company are looking for a Resourcing Business Partner to help them meet the needs of their
                            expanding customer base. The company have produced an incredibly innovative product thatâ€™s demand has grown
                            exponentially and now they have new products to bring to the market across the UK and internationally. A very exciting
                            time to be part of this company!</p>
                            <p>Reporting directly to the HR Director, you will have full ownership of the resourcing strategy and delivery of an
                            inhouse recruitment service.</p>
                            <p>The role will be worked 50% remotely and the other 50% from offices across the country (and occasionally
                            internationally) with their main office being in London. Therefore, a base in London, the Home Counties or the Midlands
                            would probably be the most ideal place for the Resourcing Business Partner to reside, but this is a suggestion, rather
                            than a requirement...</p>
