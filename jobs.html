                            <p>A growing fintech/financial services company are looking for a HR Director to come in and help the company achieve their

                            <p>The company is private-equity owned with around 160 employees currently based across two sites – central London and
                            Slough. The company offer an innovative product and their customers are both other businesses and the general public.
                            They are growing significantly, both through acquisitions and organic growth and their owners have ambitious plans to

                            <p>As a member of the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) you would be expected to be office based 5 days a week (post-pandemic).
                            You will have one direct report, at least initially. The HR function is recently established, but it is quite immature
                            and there is plenty of areas you can make an impact and shape the function; so would suit someone who maybe has worked
                            in smaller organisations or a start-up environment or simply enjoys the mixture of strategic input and execution. If you
                            like a broad remit and variety in an ambitious company, then this could be perfect for you.</p>
                            
                            <p>Responsibilities include:</p>

                            exponentially and now they have new products to bring to the market across the UK and internationally. A very exciting
                            time to be part of this company!</p>
                            <p>Reporting directly to the HR Director, you will have full ownership of the resourcing strategy and delivery of an
                            inhouse recruitment service.</p>
                            <p>The role will be worked 50% remotely and the other 50% from offices across the country (and occasionally
                            internationally) with their main office being in London. Therefore, a base in London, the Home Counties or the Midlands
                            would probably be the most ideal place for the Resourcing Business Partner to reside, but this is a suggestion, rather
                            than a requirement.</p>
